<p class="sakl">What's Arka?</p>
    <p class="sev" align="left">
    

<p class="sev2">New Arka</p>
<p class="sev">
note: Arka in this article indicates the conlang made in Earth (not in Atolas).<br>
<br>
Arka is separated into three periods below.<br>
<br>
Old Arka: from 1991 to 2001<br>
Established Arka: from 2001 to 2008<br>
New Arka: from 2008<br>
<br>
Ideograms were used in Old Arka. It was a pidgin made from various languages.<br>
Phonograms were used in Established Arka. It has a system called n-words that helped learnes memorize words of the language. Established Arka was the most conlinsguistic language of the three.<br>
N-words are excluded from New Arka. The language clears off unnatural features as a naturalistic conlang and is a well-developed artlang.<br>
<br>
Unlike Established Arka, New Arka doesn't have conlang-like features.<br>
It is less systematic, but natural.<br>
It is harder to study New Arka than do Established Arka, but still it is easier to study Arka than do other natural languages because it is a conlang.<br>
<br>
Like Established Arka, New Arka has its own conculture and conclimate. It is an a priori language like Established Arka.<br>
It is harder to study New Arka than do Established Arka, but New Arka is easier to use, easier to listen to, easier to speak and is more artistic.<br>
It is true that n-words were cleared off, but they were reincarnated as Mel Table. New Arka is a mixed language of Old Arka and Established Arka.</p>
<p class="sev2">glossary</p>
<p class="sev">
Old Arka<br>
<br>
An Arka from 1991 to 2001.<br>
<br>
It was like a pidgin language made by native speakers of various languages.<br>
Ideograms were used in Old Arka.<br>
It has more phonemes than New Arka does.<br>
The word order was SOV at first, but it became SVO later.<br>
<br>
Basically, most of the documents were written in paper, so it is hard to copy them and save them.<br>
And another problem is that the chief creator of Arka doesn't have the copyright of nearly all of the documents of Old Arka.<br>
<br>
Establieshed Arka<br>
<br>
An Arka from 2001 to 2008.<br>
The language uses the same phonemes and alphabets as New Arka.<br>
It is a conlang-like language because of n-words and the system of tenses and aspects.<br>
It is easy to memorize the language, but it is confusing to use it. That is why the language was abolished.<br>
<br>
N-words<br>
<br>
You can make many synonyms and antonyms by changing the last vowel in a word. The words are called n-words.<br>
<br>
For example, "fan" means "woman" while fin" means "man."<br>
You can make two to four words systematically by using n-words.<br>
<br>
2: ha (up), hi (down) <br>
3: bal (ceiling), bil (wall), bol (floor)<br>
4: keta (spring), keti (summer), keto (autumn), kete (winter)<br>
<br>
"u" is used for meaning the neutral concept: hu (fluctuation, up and down), fun (androgyneity, man and woman)<br>
It is easy to memorize n-words, but it is very confusing to use them, so n-words were abolished.<br>
<br>
Tenses and aspects<br>
<br>
Tenses and aspects were added to a verb in Established Arka as postfixes.<br>
<br>
Verb-Stem + Tense + Aspect = Verb<br>
<br>
e.g. ke (go) + a (past tense) + t (begin to do) = ke-at (began to go)<br>
<br>
The problem is that one sound has too much information. If the listener miss only one sound, he can't understand the meaning of the sentence properly.<br>
And that is why the system was abolished.<br>
<br>
A priori and a posteriori<br>
<br>
A priori and a posteriori: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori<br>
<br>
A priori and a posteriori: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Conlang/Types#A_priori_and_a_posteriori<br>
Particular features of a conlang can be a posteriori â€” meaning borrowed from natural languages, rather than invented â€” or a priori, meaning invented rather than borrowed from natural languages. These terms are most often used to describe the forms of words, as with the Toki Pona words toki, from the English word talk, and pona, from Latin bona (good). An entire conlang may also be described as a priori/posteriori if most of its grammar and vocabulary are of that type. A conlang described as a posteriori usually borrows from several, or even many, different natlangs; relexes are not normally called a posteriori.<br>
Classification-based vocabulary is an a priori strategy that has been used in a number of engelangs (e.g., Ro) and some auxlangs (e.g., Solresol). Most auxlangs make extensive use of a posteriori vocabulary.<br>
<br>
Conculture, conclimate and conworld<br>
<br>
A conworld consists of a conculture and conclimate.<br>
A conlang is only one component of a conworld to be exact. However, in our theory, it pairs with a conworld because it is very hard to create a language.<br>
<br>
There are a priori concultures and conclimates. And there are a posteriori concultures and conclimates.<br>
Our conworld, Kaldia, is an a priori conworld.<br>
Our conculture is called Antis.<br>
Our conclimate (or our conplanet) is called Atolas.<br>
